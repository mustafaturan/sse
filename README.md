# SSE

Server Sent Events for Elixir/Plug.

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a lightweight and standardized protocol for pushing notifications from a HTTP server to a client. In contrast to WebSocket, which offers bi-directional communication, SSE only allows for one-way communication from the server to the client. If thatâ€™s all you need, SSE has the advantages to be much simpler, to rely on HTTP 1.1 only and to offer retry semantics on broken connections by the browser.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `sse` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:sse, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

## Data Structures

To send chunks of events to client you need to create a `SSE.Chunk` data structure and Event data structure to deliver events.

### Chunk

Chunk has following attributes and only the *`data`* attribute is *required*, the rest of the attributes are optional:

`comment` - The comment line can be used to prevent connections from timing out; a server can send a comment periodically to keep the connection alive. Note: SSE package keeps connection alive for you, you don't have to send comment.

`data` - The data field for the message. When the EventSource receives multiple consecutive lines that begin with data:, it will concatenate them, inserting a newline character between each one. Trailing newlines are removed.

`event` - A string identifying the type of event described. If this is specified, an event will be dispatched on the browser to the listener for the specified event name; the web site source code should use addEventListener() to listen for named events. The onmessage handler is called if no event name is specified for a message.

`id` - The event ID to set the EventSource object's last event ID value.

`retry` - The reconnection time to use when attempting to send the event. This must be an integer, specifying the reconnection time in milliseconds. If a non-integer value is specified the field is ignored.

Sample data preperation

```elixir
chunk = %SSE.Chunk{data: ["some data", "another data"]}
```

### Event

To deliver chunks, you need to notify an `%EventBus.Model.Event{}` struct to the desired topic.

An `Event` struct may have at least 3 values:

`id` - Unique event identifier (`integer | String.t`)

`data` - Chunk data (`SSE.Chunk.t`)

`topic` - Name of the topic to deliver event (`atom`)

Sample data preparation

```elixir
chunk = %SSE.Chunk{data: "some data"}
event = EventBus.Model.Event{id: UUID.uuid4(), data: chunk, topic: :a_topic_name}
```

## Usage

SSE designed to work with any Plug app. So, it can be used with/without Phoenix Framework.

### Phoenix Framework

In your `config.exs`, register events before the app start:

```elixir
config :sse,
  keep_alive: {:system, "SSE_KEEP_ALIVE_IN_MS", 1000} # Keep alive in milliseconds

config :event_bus,
  topics: [:usd_eur_pair_updated, ...] # let's say we have a usd_eur_pair_updated event

```

In your controller:

```elixir
defmodule ExchangeRateController do
  @topic :usd_eur_pair_updated

  alias SSE.Chunk

  ...

  # Sample action to display USD to EUR exchange price
  def show(conn, _params) do
    rates = %{rates: Ticker.fetch()}
    chunk = %Chunk(data: Poison.encode!(rates))

    SSE.stream(conn, {@topic, chunk})
  end

  ...

end
```

Let's assume you have a ticker to update exchange rates:

```elixir
defmodule Ticker do
  alias EventBus.Model.Event

  @topic :usd_eur_pair_updated

  ...

  def start_link do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [], name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def fetch do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:fetch})
  end

  def init(_) do
    # Let's update the price info every second
    update_exchange_rates_later()
    {:ok, fetch_price()}
  end

  def handle_info(:update_exchange_rates, state) do
    new_rates = fetch_rates()
    unless state == new_rates do
      rates = %{rates: new_rates}
      chunk = %Chunk{data: Poison.encode!(rates)}
      event = %Event{id: UUID.uuid4(), data: chunk, topic: @topic}
      EventBus.notify(event)
    end

    update_exchange_rates_later()
    {:noreply, new_rates}
  end

  def handle_call({:fetch}, _from, state) do
    {:reply, state, state}
  end

  defp fetch_rates do
    # Get rates from somewhere...
  end

  defp update_exchange_rates_later do
    Process.send_after(self(), :update_exchange_rates, 1000)
  end

  ...
end
```

### Standalone (with Plug, with/without any framework)

All you need to change is your controller as below, the rest is the same as the Phoenix framework sample:

```elixir
defmodule ExchangeRateController do

  @topic :usd_eur_pair_updated

  alias SSE.Chunk

  ...

  get "/exchange_rates/usd_eur" do
    rates = %{rates: Ticker.fetch()}
    chunk = %Chunk(data: Poison.encode!(rates))

    conn
    |> Conn.put_resp_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
    |> SSE.stream({@topic, chunk})
  end

  ...

end
```
